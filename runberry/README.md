# RunBerry

**RunBerry** is a web interface for running executables on your Raspberry Pi. It allows you to browse your filesystem, select an executable, and run it. The output of the executable will be displayed in the browser. You can also manage the running processes and stop them if needed. The user interface is optimized for mobile devices, so you can control your Raspberry Pi from your phone or tablet.
